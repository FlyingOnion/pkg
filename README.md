# pkg
This project `github.com/FlyingOnion/pkg` provides some interesting go packages.

- `bytes` provides a substitution for official `bytes.Buffer`, with a lot of chaining `Write` methods and `If`, `ElseIf`, `Else`, `For` and `Break`;
- `log` is a **radical** logging package without any `f` methods; instead, it improves the efficiency of logging;
